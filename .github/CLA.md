# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

## Why a CLA?

FlowForge is dual-licensed under AGPL-3.0 (open source) and a commercial license. To maintain the ability to offer both licensing options, all contributors must grant Qubernetic the right to sublicense their contributions under alternative license terms.

## Agreement

By submitting a pull request or otherwise contributing to this project, you agree to the following terms:

1. **Grant of Copyright License.** You grant Qubernetic (Biró, Csaba Attila) a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute your contributions and derivative works.

2. **Grant of Patent License.** You grant Qubernetic a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer your contributions, where such license applies only to patent claims licensable by you that are necessarily infringed by your contributions alone or in combination with the project.

3. **Original Work.** You represent that your contributions are your original work and that you have the right to grant the above licenses. If your employer has rights to intellectual property that you create, you represent that you have received permission to make contributions on behalf of that employer.

4. **No Warranty.** You provide your contributions on an "AS IS" basis, without warranties or conditions of any kind.

5. **Notification.** You agree to notify Qubernetic of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make your representations inaccurate in any respect.

## How to Sign

This CLA is accepted automatically when you submit a pull request. The [CLA Assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/) bot will verify your signature. First-time contributors will be asked to sign electronically by commenting on their pull request.
